# Project : ItemCatalog
  # Overview
   You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and    authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
   
# Tools
   Vagrant: Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow               and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the                     "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past. https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/index.html
